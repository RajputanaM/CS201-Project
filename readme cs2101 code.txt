In the implemantion of map we use Dijksatra's Algorithm for finding  shortest path.
In this Program first we take input for implemantation of map.
first user input how many cities he want to add in the map.  then he will enter city name and unique code for that city for traverse the graph easily. 
after then he input distance for path to one city to another , once he input all the distance then for stop the entry he input city name Stop and Stop and distance 
-1. after then he enters source city for finding the shortest distance between source city to all the city that is added on the map.
after all input, program gives output the shortest distance between source city to all other city.
last he enter source city and destination city then our program gives the shortest path to reach source city to destination city.
